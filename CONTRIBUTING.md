## Contributing

Similar to [Wikipedia's contributors' rights and obligations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights#Contributors.27_rights_and_obligations), by submitting content to this repository, you release your work to the public domain, and thus grant viewers permission to use, copy, distribute and/or modify your work under the terms of the Creative Commons Public Domain License, the original at https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ or any later version published by Creative Commons; with either a waiver of rights, or an assertion that no rights attach to a particular work.

In order to contribute, you must be in a position to agree to the terms of this license, which means that either:

* you hold the copyright to the material, for instance because you produced it yourself, or
* because the material is in the public domain

In the first case, you release copyright to your materials. You can later republish them in any way you like. However, you can never retract the public domain license for the copies of materials that you place here; these copies will remain under public domain license.
