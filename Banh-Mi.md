# Banh Mi

This traditional Vietnamese street food has barbecued pork, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, and chili paste. Should be served on a baguette.

## Pickled Carrots and Daikon

### Ingredients
- 2 pounds carrots (about 5 medium sized carrots), peeled
- 2 pounds of daikon radishes (about 2 large daikon), peeled
- 1 cup plus 4 teaspoons of sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 2 1/2 cups white vinegar
- 2 cups warm water (warm enough to easily dissolve sugar)
- About 5 pint jars

1. Julienne the carrots and the daikon radishes.
2. Place the carrots and daikon radishes in a large bowl. Sprinkle with 4 teaspoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of salt. Use your clean hands to toss the carrots and daikon with the salt and sugar until well coated. Continue to mix the carrots and daikon with your hands until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. They are ready once you can bend a piece of daikon all the way over without it breaking.

3. Transfer the carrots and daikon to a colander, rinse with cool water and drain well.

4. In a bowl mix together one cup of sugar, the white vinegar and the warm water, until the sugar dissolves.

5. Prepare clean jars. Pack the daikon and carrots tightly into the jars. Pour over the pickling liquid to cover. Seal. Refrigerate.

The pickles should sit at least overnight before eating; their flavor will improve with time. They should last 4 to 6 weeks in the refrigerator.


## Thit Nuong - Vietnamese Grilled Pork

### Ingredients
- 4 pounds pork butt or top sirloin, thinly sliced
- 3 shallots, finely minced
- 5 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 1/2 cup lemon-grass, finely minced
- 3 tablespoons white sesame seeds
- 3 1/2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1/2 tablespoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil

1. Combine all ingredients from shallots through vegetable oil in a large bowl. Add the sliced pork to the bowl. Using your hands, massage the meat and marinade to make sure that the marinade is evenly distributed and coats every slice of meat. Allow the meat to soak in the marinade overnight or for up to 24 hours.

2. Put pork in oiled "meat-cage" or skewer onto damp bamboo sticks.

3. Grill the meat on low to medium heat with the lid closed for most of the time in order to keep the meat moist. Flip the meat cage once the pork has developed a sear and is evenly caramelized on one side.

## Chili Paste

- 6 ounces hot chilies, stemmed and chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 1/2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar

1. Put all the ingredients in an electric mini chopper or food processor. Process to a coarse texture.

2. Transfer to a small jar and refrigerate. Let stand at least 30 minutes before using to allow the flavors to blend.
